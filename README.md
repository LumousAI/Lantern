__Lantern__ tries to make machine learning more interpretable!  
Towards interepretable machine learning (IML), Lantern is an open source tool to shed light on your models!

#### Why should I use it?!
If you want to debug your models, Lantern can be a great tool to use. Lantern uses other IML tools/libraries and can give you 

#### Is it free?!
Of course, it's open source. But try to reference the source for the algorithms that you use. A list of implemented algorithms and methods are shown in references.
